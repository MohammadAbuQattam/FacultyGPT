 year 4 courses and suggested plan for year 4

 general guidelines
- each academic year comprises three semesters: first semester, second semester, and an optional summer semester.
- first and second semesters are mandatory.
- students must adhere to prerequisites; courses without the necessary prerequisites cannot be registered.
- courses should not be repeated across semesters unless the student fails them.
