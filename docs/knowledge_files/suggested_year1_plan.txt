# year 1 courses and suggested plan

general guidelines
- each academic year comprises three semesters: first semester, second semester, and an optional summer semester.
- first and second semesters are mandatory.
- students can enroll in four university requirement courses (3 credit hours each) during their first year.
- students must adhere to prerequisites; courses without the necessary prerequisites cannot be registered.
- courses should not be repeated across semesters unless the student fails them.
- a course and its prerequisite can not be taken in the same semester,you should make that clear in your answers

courses and prerequisites for year 1 students:

remedial computer skills
- prerequisites: none
- enables registration for: computer skills for scientific faculties
- notes: equivalent to passing a qualification exam. if passed, the course should be skipped.

for the summer semester, students have the option to register for courses, but it is not mandatory. they are eligible to enroll in courses for which they have met the prerequisites. specifically, students can choose to register for courses from the first year which they haven't finished, courses from the second year, required university courses, or any elective courses.
