all courses are 3 credit hours, except for labs. 
in year 2, semester 2, you can enroll in principles of statistics , as well as advanced programming in special languages (prerequisites: data structures), and numerical analysis (prerequisites: linear algebra for computational sciences, computer skills for scientific faculties) and theory of computation (discrete mathematics, computer skills for scientific faculties), and one of the university required/elective courses. principles of statistics is a prerequisite for modeling and simulation and computer systems performance and applied statistics. advanced programming in special languages is prerequisite for design patterns and clean code. numerical analysis isn't a prerequisite for anything. theory of computation is a prerequisite for systems programming and compilers construction. 

# year 2 - summer semester
credit hours: up to 12
all courses are 3 credit hours, except for labs. 
during the summer semesters, you have the flexibility to skip. however, if you choose to enroll in your year 2 summer semester, you can take any remaining year 2 courses you might have not completed in semester 1 or semester 2. alternatively you can enroll for any year 3 course whos requirments you have already fullfilled early such as software engineering(prerequisites: database management systems), computer networks(prerequisites: data structures), theory of algorithms(prerequisites: data structures) and if you want also a university required/elective course.
